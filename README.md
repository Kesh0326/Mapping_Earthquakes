# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

To map earthquake data on a map along with tectonic plates and major earthquake information

## Approach

By using Leaflet.js and making API requests it was possible to map geoJSON data on a map indicating the size and color of each earthquake based on degree of magnitude of the earthquake. By incorporating popup markers through the bindPopup method, it was possible to indicate the magnitude and location of each earthquake by clicking on the circle marker.

## Inference

While there are many minor magnitude earthquakes (< 3 Richters) in the Alaska, San Franscisco and Nevada areas, the major earthquakes (> 5 Richters) are more scattered with Indonesia and surrounding parts of South East Asia recording a majority of them.
